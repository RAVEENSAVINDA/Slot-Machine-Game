# Slot-Machine-Game

This is a GUI application which represents a Slot machine game.  This slot machine has three reels with six different types of symbols. The user gets the chance to spin these three reels and after the spin if all the reels got the same symbol, the game is won. To play a game there must be credits and the player must redeem the credits as bets to play the game. If the player is won, the bet amount and winning credits are added to the remaining credits. Winning credits are calculated according to the assigned value of the symbol. Reels are implemented using threads in java. I have used jFreeCharts to implement and customize the Pie chart which displays the statistics. The MVC architecture was used to build this programme.

Full detailed document about the application is availble in [Design and Details.pdf](../master/Design and Details.pdf) file.
